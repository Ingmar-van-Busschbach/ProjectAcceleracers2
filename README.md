# ProjectAcceleracers2
 
Project Acceleracers 2 or PA2 for short is a racing game based on the Hot Wheels Acceleracers franchise. It is free to play, and follows a fan-game, fair-use no profit license. This means that distribution of the game can never be profited off in any way, shape or form, regardless of who distributes it.

PA2 is a successor to [Project Acceleracer](https://ingmarmatthis.nl/project-acceleracer/about.html), and expands upon the original game's technology by constructing a new vehicle physics engine from scratch. Beyond that, it is planned to have a story mode for the game, where scenes of the original source content are played between scripted races.

Total planned features list:
- Feature complete levels that are faithful to the source materials.
- Custom, simcade-like car physics with distinct performance archetypes
- Car appearance customization
- AI cars to race against
- Animated UI menu's
- Power-ups in the forms of accelechargers and team-based abilities
- Dynamic audio using FMOD integrated sound projects
- Better optimization than its predecessor

PA2 as a project follows the [Allar Style Guide for UE5](https://github.com/Allar/ue5-style-guide).
